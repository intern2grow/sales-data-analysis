# Sales Data Analysis

An assessment prepared by Intern2Grow, for its Data Analyst Virtual Internship Program.

## Assessment Overview

For this assessment, you will be given a small dataset and a set of questions to answer using that data. You will be expected to use your data analysis skills to answer the questions and present your findings in a clear and concise manner.

## Dataset

The dataset you will be using is a CSV file called sales_data.csv. It contains information about sales made by a fictional company over the course of a year. The columns in the dataset are as follows:

- product: The name of the product sold
- category: The category of the product (e.g. "electronics", "clothing", etc.)
- price: The price of the product (in USD)
- quantity: The quantity of the product sold
- revenue: The total revenue generated by the sale (i.e. price * quantity)

Don't forget to clean the data provided in the CSV file.
